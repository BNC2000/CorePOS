#  $ apt-get install composer
$ composer install
# This may not work because of missing PHP extensions:
#  "the requested PHP extension gd is missing from your system."
# To get them under Ubuntu:
# $ apt-cache search gd php
# If that reports it available:
# php5.6-gd - GD module for PHP
# then
# $ apt-get install php5.6-gd
# Try again
# $ composer update
# If it succeeds composer.lock is created.
